            A Software Developer forging the future with IoT solutions and
            innovative side projects. I thrive on creating intelligent systems
            that bridge the physical and digital realms.

            My passion lies in architecting and developing robust, scalable
            software for the Internet of Things. From crafting firmware for
            microcontrollers like ESP32 and Raspberry Pi, to integrating with
            cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud IoT) and building
            insightful data visualizations, I enjoy working across the entire
            IoT ecosystem. I'm driven by complex challenges and the opportunity
            to transform conceptual ideas into tangible, impactful technology.
